# FUNC-E

FUNC-E is a Perl script used for functional enrichment of gene lists. It follows a similar approach to that of [DAVID] (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) in that it performs enrichment analysis using a Fisher's test but then clusters enriched annotations using Kappa Statistics.  FUNC-E allows the user to provide their own annotation lists. It is fully executable on a UNIX command-line.
